This is a test file.
This file will be sent from RPI3 to host PC via WIFI.
In case of any data loss CRC32 needs tobe implemented.

1) To verify parity byte unsigned short needs to be considered.

Say CRC polynomial is 11010010010110101

Sender:
data is --> 1010......01110 (1022 bytes) 
CRC is --> 2 bytes

result = data;
for(int i = 0;i< 1022*8; ){
	if(result << i){
		poly << = (1022*8) - i;
		result ^ = poly;
	}

}



So what i am saying first i will send the text file from rpi to host pc then
we will check what is the problem.... If any found then we shall implement checksum
for transmit and finally check the data at receiving end.

1> .......... lets hope for the best.
